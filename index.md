### Introduction
<img src="images/tiff.jpg">

Hey! I'm a senior at UC Davis graduating in March 2017 with a degree in Applied Statistics with emphasis in Managerial Economics. Broadly speaking, I am interested in careers relating to the cross between data and business. I'm interested in data visualizations and the story telling part of data science. My hobbies include everything outdoors: hiking, camping, swimming, and simply being in nature, as well as <a href = "http://vsco.co/tiffchen/images/1">photography </a> and creative outlets like <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpWsiP_qvnYERqCzTr77efA">YouTube </a> and fashion.
