### Introduction
<img src="images/tiff.jpg">

My name is Tiffany and I'm a senior at UC Davis graduating in March 2017 with a degree in Applied Statistics with emphasis in Managerial Economics. I am interested in careers relating to the cross between data and business. I'm interested in data visualizations and the story telling part of data sceince. My hobbies include everything outdoors - hiking, camping, swimming, and simply being in nature, photography, and creative outlets like Youtube and fashion.
